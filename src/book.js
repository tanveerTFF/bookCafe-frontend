    review: `This is a more detailed review of the book that will show in
      the popup.Days later, Nick reluctantly accompanies a drunken and
      agitated Tom to New York City by train. 
      
      En route, they stop at a 
      garage inhabited by mechanic George Wilson and his wife—and Tom's
      mistress—Myrtle. Myrtle joins them, and the trio proceeds to a
      small New York apartment that Tom has rented for trysts with her.
      Guests arrive and a party ensues, which ends with Tom slapping 
      Myrtle and breaking her nose after she mentions Daisy.
      One morning, Nick receives a formal invitation to a party at 
      Gatsby's mansion. Once there, Nick is embarrassed that 
      he recognizes no one and begins drinking heavily until
      he encounters Jordan. While chatting with her, he is 
      approached by a man who introduces himself as Jay Gatsby 
      and insists that both he and Nick served in the 3rd Infantry 
      Division[c] during the war. Gatsby attempts to ingratiate 
      himself with Nick and when Nick leaves the party, he notices 
      Gatsby watching him.In late July, Nick and Gatsby have lunch at
      a speakeasy. Gatsby tries impressing Nick with tales of his 
      war heroism and his Oxford days. Afterward, Nick meets Jordan
